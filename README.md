# StaveEditor


### Limitations

  - DB had been deleted, so all the php files cannot work.
  - final_index.php is the index of the original project
  - The project with original DB can perform login/logout.
  - Now you can simply use index.html to try the Stave editing.


### Usage:
  - Use 1~7 to input notes from C to B, respectively.
  - Use mouse to select different notes, flat/sharp...etc
  - Press ctrl+z to undo your input.
  - Click "End" to end editing. Click "Start" to Continue.
  - Click "Output" to output your stave.


### Future work:
  - Rebuild the database.
  - Functions: Save(save your work), Download(dowload your work to continue editing)
  - Interaction: directly use mouse to click on the stave to add notes.(Reference: VexUI)
